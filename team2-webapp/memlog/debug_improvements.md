# Debugging Improvements Documentation

## Overview
Added comprehensive debugging throughout the application to improve monitoring, troubleshooting, and development experience.

## Key Components Enhanced

### 1. Debug Utility (`src/utils/debug.js`)
- Created centralized debugging utility with multiple log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG, PERF)
- Added performance timing capabilities for tracking operation durations
- Implemented structured logging with timestamps and component context
- Added specialized logging for different operation types:
  - File operations
  - API requests/responses
  - Socket events
  - State changes

### 2. Server (`server.js`)
- Added detailed request logging for all API endpoints
- Implemented file operation tracking
- Added WebSocket connection monitoring
- Enhanced error handling with detailed context
- Added performance metrics for file operations
- Improved path validation logging

### 3. FileWatcher Service (`src/services/fileWatcher.js`)
- Added comprehensive WebSocket connection monitoring
- Enhanced file change detection logging
- Improved error handling and retry logic
- Added performance tracking for file operations
- Implemented detailed state transition logging

### 4. React Components
#### App.jsx
- Added component lifecycle logging
- Enhanced state change tracking
- Improved error boundary logging
- Added performance monitoring for updates
- Implemented debug panel for real-time monitoring

#### MessageList.jsx
- Added message processing logging
- Enhanced render cycle tracking
- Improved error handling for message formatting

#### MessageBubble.jsx
- Added style computation logging
- Enhanced timestamp formatting debugging
- Improved render optimization tracking

#### PathInput.jsx
- Added input validation logging
- Enhanced path processing debugging
- Improved error handling for validation

## Debug Features

### Performance Monitoring
- Operation timing for critical paths
- Duration tracking for file operations
- API request/response timing
- Component render timing

### Error Tracking
- Detailed error context
- Stack trace preservation
- Error recovery logging
- Validation failure tracking

### State Management
- State transition logging
- Component update tracking
- WebSocket connection state monitoring
- File watcher state tracking

### Real-time Monitoring
- Debug panel for live log viewing
- Message processing visualization
- File change detection monitoring
- Socket connection status tracking

## Usage

### Debug Panel
- Toggle visibility with the debug panel button
- Shows last 50 log entries
- Includes timestamps and structured data
- Color-coded by log level

### Console Output
- Detailed logs in browser console
- Structured JSON for complex data
- Performance metrics
- Error traces with context

### Server Logs
- API endpoint access logs
- File operation tracking
- WebSocket connection events
- Error and warning alerts

## Benefits
1. Improved development experience with real-time feedback
2. Faster issue identification and resolution
3. Better understanding of application state
4. Enhanced performance monitoring
5. Simplified troubleshooting process

## Future Improvements
1. Add log persistence for post-mortem analysis
